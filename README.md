# C64 Cat & Mushroom Sprite Game

This project features a fully animated cat sprite that moves down the screen while collecting color-changing mushroom sprites on the Commodore 64. The program demonstrates sprite animation, collision logic, color cycling, and real-time on-screen interaction using 6502 assembly.
